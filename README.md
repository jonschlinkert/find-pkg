# find-pkg [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/find-pkg.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-pkg) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/find-pkg.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/find-pkg) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/find-pkg.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/find-pkg)

Find the first directory with a package.json, recursing up, starting with the given directory. Similar to look-up but does not support globs and only searches for package.json. Async and sync.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install find-pkg --save
```

Uses [find-file-up](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/find-file-up), which is based on [look-up](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/look-up) but faster since it does not support globs.

## Usage

```js
var findPkg = require('find-pkg');

findPkg('.', function(err, fp) {
  //=> /User/jonschlinkert/dev/find-pkg/package.json
});

var fp = findPkg.sync('.');
//=> /User/jonschlinkert/dev/find-pkg/package.json
```
